Awakening of ***,
Pain, weakened muscles ,
Alone in his cave ,
Outer skin has gone,
Dressed in his shadow and red ,
"Reflect!.. Hey, mirror!",
(He's turning silent , but mad)
...
No one left there alive to do him a bow,
Actually, skeletons were standing on their knees, in their own dust - looked like a snow ,
(That made him feel a bit sad)
...
Giving his blood to the time,
"Here, make deserts wet..
And my flowers to grow,"
(She stood still, shook her head)
"They're ready to sow..!
..To grow skin flowers above time flesh"..,
(But she sucked in her all )
...
Now, the *** regaining power , won't wait for his death,
False time with face mirror, he was under her press,
Broke down as all lies will ever do, when he revealed her,

The end.''
