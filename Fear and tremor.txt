Fear and tremor

Fear envelops my entire body
It awakens
A phantom
And reason
Fear engulfs his essence
The puzzle has been solved by the swindler
We receive
The release of our prisoner

It's extraordinary how fear is
It claims to know what we already know
But the heart resists from within
Trying to decrypt
And recognize where it comes from

At times, the past echoes the old releases
It haunts
Reminding us of everything that has happened before
Similar to this one

Thus begins paranoia
And we try to remember the forgotten
In darkness, we assume
That everything is peaceful

Will you choose fear or the heart?
Ah, if you choose the heart
The unreal fear will be denied from the outside
I can't recognize it then
Who will conquer it with force?

We have both, and we choose both
With the third, we surrender to them
Filtering what and why
And for what reason
There is a release
Fear is banished, leaving only trembling

Receiving him is like
Loving, not
An enemy's
Receiving

Love fear
Learn it
What is inside you
Deceived

Release it with trembling
Prepare a new heart with fear
