I won't hide where I'm from
& I can't hide from you what's happening there
What's wrong
Everything's fine, only godlessness reigns
Everything is fine, until that fragile moment
Which he will call one in a million and exceptional
Until it's confirmed, there will be no one left
How sad it is
His skin is stretched and freckled
He got everyone's voice
The sound of his breathing is with me all the time
That genius clown
I can't hide from you whose shoulder I'm riding on
& I will also tell you that I whisper him about god
While I know nothing myself
But still
