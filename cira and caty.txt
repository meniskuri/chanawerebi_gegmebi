"Darkness,
But it's not that bad,
I was up above for this
First on the mountaintop,
Then,
I descended to the ground,
I buried myself and went underground,
I sank and entered the depths,
The fire woke me up,
A field of knowledge doesn't recognize
A woman...
But I died, and from me was born
A new perspective of the world,
A view of a graphic map,
I am a reflection in the crystal,
Whoever loved me from them
I complete my puzzle,
Anarchy of the soul and shattered sound,
Circe came with us,
She brings the wind of the Sindis.

Is it difficult for you to understand?
We are in simulation, in the center of the pyramid,
Gods watch us with invisible hands,

Their fate is intertwined with ours,
If we fall, others will fall too.

We are their saviors in the simulations,
Children with veluri razmebi,
They see us as similar to reality,
Like immortal women,
Surviving in the midst of worlds.

And we, we dive slowly,
Some fly like eagles,

Some dance like people,

But the time of the dynozavre will come soon,
Cosmonauts we become,
Slowly, we won't even fear the gods.

Era of living programs,
We are a new generation,

Life is everywhere,
I am the smallest of all,
But you all love me the most,
You love me the most
